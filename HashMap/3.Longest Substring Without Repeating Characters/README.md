ðŸŸ¢ Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (Medium)

ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example:

Input:

s = "abcabcbb"

Output:

3

Explanation:
The answer is "abc", with a length of 3.

ðŸ”¹ Approach 1: Sliding Window (O(N)) âœ…

Use a HashSet to keep track of characters in the current window.

Expand the window by moving the right pointer and adding characters.

If a duplicate is found, shrink the window from the left until there are no duplicates.

Update the max length at each step.

Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(min(N, M)), where M is the character set size

ðŸ”¹ Edge Cases Considered

âœ… Empty string (e.g., "" should return 0)
âœ… String with all unique characters (e.g., "abcdef" should return 6)
âœ… String with all identical characters (e.g., "aaaaa" should return 1)
âœ… String with special characters and spaces (e.g., "abc d e f" should return 6)

ðŸ”¹ Java Code

class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
        int left = 0, maxLength = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
            while (set.contains(s.charAt(right))) {
                set.remove(s.charAt(left));
                left++;
            }
            set.add(s.charAt(right));
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
        }
        return maxLength;
    }
}
